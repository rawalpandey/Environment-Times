 <h2>Key environmental issues observed under the project</h2>
  <h4>Air Pollution</h4>
  <p class="marg"> Pune needs to breathe easy. It is one of India's most polluted cities resulting in increasing incidences of respiratory disease. And people with respiratory diseases are more prone to the H1N1 flu. The prime source of SPM (Suspended Particulate Matter) is the increasing numbers of vehicles, industries in the vicinity of the city, and construction sites. This is one of the major concerns for air pollution. The SPM situation worsened during July and August 2009 due to high precipitation levels as compared to the other months. The H1N1 epidemic was also at its peak during the same period. In fact, Pune's recorded RSPM (Respiratory Suspended Particulate Matter) is 1.5 times more than the national standards.</p>

  </div>
  According to the Water Supply and Sewerage departments of PMC, only 55% of the total generated sewerage in the city is treated. The remaining 45% is released into the river untreated and leads to high levels of both BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand). At six sampling locations along the Mula river, the recorded BOD levels were found to be higher than the permissible limits set by MPCB. The recorded COD levels were also above the permissible limits. </p>

    <div class="text3"> Estimates show that over 40% of Pune's population <br/> lives in slums </div>
  </div>
  It is estimated that over 40% of Pune's population lives in slums. However, 
  it is feared that if slums continue to grow at the current pace, almost 50% 
  of the city's population will soon be residing in these shanty towns. In order 
  to tackle this issue, boundaries defined by the Hill and Hill Slopes department 
  have to be followed stringently. This, coupled with encroachment of footpaths 
  built for pedestrian use, is a grave issue which requires immediate attention. </p> 
  <p>This report is based on the data obtained from both governmental and non-governmental institutes, as well as data provided by HoDs (Head of Department) of respective departments at PMC. Furthermore, for better understanding, past reports for Pune and other cities including those for Kolhapur, Navi Mumbai, and Thane were reviewed and analyzed. </p>
  <p>An earnest effort was also made to involve all stakeholders (senior citizens, NGO representatives, and experts) during compilation of data and drafting of the report. Periodic meetings were arranged with members of the ESR committee to elicit suggestions and comments which were incorporated in the report.<br />
